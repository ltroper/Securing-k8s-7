### Securing-K8s-7: Encrypting Confidential Data with Encryption Configuration on Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)

In this guide, we will configure **encryption at rest** for Kubernetes Secrets stored in **etcd** on **Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)**. This ensures sensitive information is securely encrypted using the **aesgcm** provider, a robust and efficient encryption standard. Weâ€™ll also discuss the benefits of encrypting Secrets, the risks of neglecting this practice, and real-world applications of this setup.

### Benefits of Encrypting Secrets vs. Risks of Not Doing So

#### **Benefits**:
1. **Data Security**: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information (e.g., passwords, tokens) stored in etcd.
2. **Compliance**: Align with industry regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which mandate robust data protection.
3. **Defense in Depth**: Add an additional layer of security to mitigate risks from potential etcd compromises.

#### **Risks of Not Encrypting Secrets**:
1. **Exposure**: Sensitive data in plaintext can be accessed if etcd is breached.
2. **Compliance Violations**: Risk of legal and financial penalties for non-compliance with security standards.
3. **Increased Attack Surface**: An attacker with access to etcd gains full visibility into sensitive Kubernetes data.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:
1. **Access to LKE**: You have a running Kubernetes cluster on LKE.
2. **kubectl Configured**: Your `kubectl` is configured to interact with the LKE cluster.
3. **Backup Setup**: You have a mechanism to back up etcd data before making encryption changes.

### Step 2: Create an Encryption Configuration File

1. On your local machine, create an encryption configuration file named `encryption-config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
   kind: EncryptionConfiguration
   resources:
     - resources:
         - secrets
       providers:
         - aescbc:
             keys:
               - name: key1
                 secret: c2VjdXJlLXNlY3JldC1rZXktaGV4LXN0cmluZw==
         - identity: {}
   ```

   - **aescbc**: Configures encryption using AES-CBC with a unique key.
   - **identity**: Specifies no encryption for backward compatibility. This is included as a fallback.

2. Store this file securely, as it contains sensitive information.

---

### Step 3: Update the LKE API Server

LKE is a managed Kubernetes service, so direct access to the API server configuration is restricted. However, you can specify custom configurations through **Linode Support** or by utilizing Kubernetes control-plane APIs.

1. Contact Linode Support to apply the `encryption-config.yaml` file to your cluster.
2. Alternatively, if you self-host etcd (e.g., using a separate Linode VM), you can configure encryption directly.

---

### Step 4: Create and Test a Secret

To validate encryption, create a Kubernetes Secret and confirm it is stored encrypted in etcd.

#### 1. Define a Secret:

Create a file `my-secret.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=  # Base64 for "admin"
  password: MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm  # Base64 for "1f2d1e2e67df"
```

Apply the Secret:

```bash
kubectl apply -f my-secret.yaml
```

#### 2. Verify the Secret Exists:

```bash
kubectl get secret my-secret -o yaml
```

Ensure the Secret is successfully created and visible.

---

### Step 5: Verify Encryption in etcd

To confirm the Secret is encrypted in etcd:

1. Use the etcdctl tool on a Linode instance hosting etcd or access the control plane:

   ```bash
   etcdctl --endpoints=<etcd-endpoint> get /registry/secrets/default/my-secret --cert=<path-to-cert> --key=<path-to-key> --cacert=<path-to-cacert>
   ```

   Replace placeholders with appropriate values for your setup.

2. The output should display an encrypted form of the Secret, validating that encryption is working.

### Real-World Applications of Encryption in Kubernetes

#### **Use Case 1: Securing API Keys and Passwords**
- Encrypting Secrets ensures that sensitive credentials used by applications remain secure, even if etcd is compromised.

#### **Use Case 2: Meeting Compliance**
- Organizations subject to regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS for payment data, HIPAA for healthcare data) can use this setup to fulfill encryption requirements.

#### **Use Case 3: Mitigating Insider Threats**
- Encrypting Secrets minimizes risks from insider attacks by restricting access to sensitive information, even for privileged users.

#### **Use Case 4: Protecting Multi-Tenant Environments**
- In environments hosting multiple tenants (e.g., SaaS platforms), encryption at rest ensures data isolation and protection.

---

### Step 6: Ongoing Management

#### Rotate Encryption Keys
To maintain security, rotate encryption keys periodically by updating `encryption-config.yaml` with new keys:

```yaml
- aescbc:
    keys:
      - name: key2
        secret: bmV3LXNlY3JldC1rZXktaGV4LXN0cmluZw==
      - name: key1
        secret: c2VjdXJlLXNlY3JldC1rZXktaGV4LXN0cmluZw==
```

Restart the API server and re-encrypt data:

```bash
kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o yaml | kubectl replace -f -
```

---

### Conclusion

Encrypting Secrets in LKE using **Encryption Configuration** strengthens the security of sensitive data and aligns with compliance requirements. By implementing this feature, you protect your cluster against unauthorized access, insider threats, and potential regulatory violations. Regular key rotation and monitoring are essential for maintaining a secure environment in real-world applications.
